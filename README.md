# Chatbot Implementation using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is capable of understanding and responding to user queries in a conversational manner.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: The chatbot preprocesses text to remove stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant tokens.
- **Intent Classification**: It identifies the intent of the user's message using machine learning models.
- **Response Generation**: Based on the identified intent, the chatbot provides appropriate responses.
- **NLP Techniques**: The chatbot uses several NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras (Optional, if using deep learning models)
- Regular Expressions (re)
- Pandas

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-nlp.git
   cd chatbot-nlp
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the necessary datasets (if any) and place them in the appropriate directory.

## Usage
Run the chatbot using the following command:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```
The chatbot will prompt you to enter a message. Type your message and press Enter. The chatbot will respond with an appropriate answer.

## File Structure
```bash

├── chatbot.py            # Main script for running the chatbot
├── intents.json          # File containing various intents and responses
├── requirements.txt      # List of required Python libraries

├── data_preprocessing.py # Script for data preprocessing
└── README.md             # This file
```

## How It Works
### Data Preprocessing:
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words.
- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base form (e.g., "running" -> "run").
- **Vectorization**: Converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF or Word2Vec.

### Intent Classification:
We train a machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, or Neural Network) to classify user queries into predefined intents.

### Response Generation:
The chatbot selects a response based on the predicted intent.

## Example
```
User: "What is NLP?"
Chatbot: "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language."
```
